## Project Title: Leveraging Graph Neural Networks for Unraveling Key Gene Co-expression Networks in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

### Project Proposal: 
This project aims to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze RNA-seq data from AML patients, constructing and interpreting gene co-expression networks to identify critical genes and interactions underlying the disease's pathogenesis. By applying GNNs to model the complex relationships between genes, we seek to uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for understanding and treating AML.
